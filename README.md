# **ShareJoy**  

## **Project Overview**  

**ShareJoy** is a web platform dedicated to connecting people with children's homes, teen mother shelters, and charitable organizations across Kenya. Our mission is to make volunteering, donating, and supporting these homes seamless and impactful.  

This project directly aligns with the following **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**  

### 🌍 **SDG 1: No Poverty**  
By enabling direct donations and volunteer opportunities, **ShareJoy** helps provide financial and material support to vulnerable children and young mothers.  

### 🍽 **SDG 2: Zero Hunger**  
Through food donations and partnerships with children's homes, **ShareJoy** ensures that underprivileged communities have access to essential nutrition.  

### ❤️ **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**  
The platform helps direct resources—such as medical aid, shelter, and psychological support—to children and teen mothers in need, improving overall community health.  

### 📚 **SDG 4: Quality Education**  
Education is key to breaking the cycle of poverty. **ShareJoy** connects donors with homes that provide learning resources and skill development programs.  

### 🤝 **SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities**  
By making it easier to support those in need, **ShareJoy** fosters a more inclusive society, reducing disparities in access to basic needs.  

### 🏙 **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**  
Encouraging community involvement and sustainable charitable giving helps create stronger, more resilient communities.
